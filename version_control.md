## QUESTIONS

>Why would you want to version control your code?
* Version control allows changes be managed by a gatekeeper. This is useful when several team members are contributing to the code.
* Version control also allows you maintain a stable, working version of the project that you can retreat to if problems are created by subsequent additions to the code.

>Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?
* Git Education has a lot of aids that catalog and explain available commands.
* I could also use the internet.

>Why are branches useful?
* Branches allow you to try out new additions to code and to develop them fully without having to commit to their full inclusion in the app/website/project.
* They also permit other team members to contribute by submitting to the gatekeeper.

>What is the purpose of a remote?
* The remote functions as a repository that is available for you to access from other locations, as well as serving as a central hub for multiple contributors to add to.

>Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?
* If your local repository differs from the remote upstream, there could be conflicts between your additions and those of other team members.
